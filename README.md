# FiveSPN-BioGen

FiveSPN-BioGen is a FiveM resource for generating random names and dates of birth for online server gameplay. These names can be used to quickly create personas for role-players or to generate information given to game AI.
FiveSPN-Persona and FiveSPN-Ai use this resource. 

## Prerequisites

## Installation
